# Week 3 - Day 3: JavaScript â€“ Callbacks, Promises, async/await

## ðŸ§  Real-World Scenario
You're working in a modern JavaScript codebase where asynchronous operations (like API calls) are common. You'll be refactoring and writing utility functions using callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task
Complete the `index.js` file:
1. Write a callback-based function (e.g., fetchData(cb))
2. Convert a callback function into a Promise-based solution
3. Write a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds
4. Use async/await to simulate an API fetch (with setTimeout or Promise)
5. Handle errors using .catch and try...catch

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Scoring
5 test cases Ã— 20 points = 100 points

## ðŸš€ Steps
1. Edit `index.js` and complete the functions
2. Use callbacks, Promises, and async/await syntax appropriately
